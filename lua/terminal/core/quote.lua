---@module 'terminal.core.quote'
--- Pure shell quoting for text that is typed into a terminal.
---
--- Anything that reaches a shell as one *line* must be quoted for **that** shell: a name with a
--- space, `;`, `$(...)`, a backtick or a quote would otherwise be interpreted instead of passed.
--- The shells covered: POSIX (`sh`, `bash`, `zsh`), `fish` (its own single-quote rules: a backslash
--- is an escape inside '...'), PowerShell (`powershell`, `pwsh`) and `cmd.exe`. A shell that is none
--- of them (`nu`, `csh`, ...) is NOT covered and is treated as POSIX -- name it in the `shell`
--- config and the quoting is a guess for it; the "portable" kind (see below) is the safe choice.
---
--- `argv_to_line` and `shell_kind` are the entries the rest of the plugin uses (`word`, the quoting
--- of a single word, is only reached through `argv_to_line`); the plugin never builds a line from
--- an unquoted string. The first word of a line is the program: POSIX shells and fish quote it
--- unless it is a plain program name (a bare `NAME=value` there is an assignment, `.` is `source`).
--- A word that cannot be represented safely for the shell is **refused**
--- (`nil, err`), never guessed at. What is refused, by family:
---
---   - every family: a control character (line break, TAB, NUL, ESC, ...);
---   - cmd.exe: a `%` (it has no way to quote it);
---   - PowerShell: a word with a double quote, a word with white space that ends in a backslash,
---     the empty word and the word `--%`. How a program started from PowerShell receives the first
---     two differs between Windows PowerShell 5.1, pwsh before 7.3 (legacy argument passing) and
---     later (5.1 splits a word at the quote, drops it, or lets the trailing backslash swallow the
---     NEXT argument), and the other two never arrive (the empty word is dropped by 5.1 and by
---     legacy passing, `--%` by every version, quoted or not), so no single quoting is right;
---     `direct = true` passes the argument without a shell;
---   - "portable" (a multiplexer's unknown shell): anything beyond letters, digits and `. _ / : -`,
---     and a word that starts with a dash and holds a `:` or a `.`;
---   - an argv with a hole (`nil` between two words) in every family: the words after it would be
---     lost without a sound, so it is not a list of words.

--- a lone `.` is `source`, `:` the null command, `%1` a job spec, `-` a precommand modifier in
--- zsh, and a reserved word is syntax. A program name is made of letters, digits and `_ / . + -`
--- and starts with a letter, a digit, `_`, `/` or `.` (`./run.sh`); `=` never belongs to it.

--- fish: inside '...' a backslash escapes `\` and `'` (anything else after a backslash stays

--- (unlike zsh, see `posix`), so `=` stays in the set at every position of an argument; the

--- and `C:\my dir\` makes the last backslash escape the closing quote, which swallows the NEXT
--- argument. pwsh 7.3+ gets both right for a program (not for a .bat / .cmd). No single quoting is
--- right for all of them, so a word with a `"`, and a word with white space that ends in a
--- backslash, are refused (same principle as `portable`). The empty word and `--%` are refused for
