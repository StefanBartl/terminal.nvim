-- TESTS/support/shells.lua -- small models of how the target programs read a quoted word, so a
-- spec can check that quoting survives the round trip instead of comparing strings.
--
--   posix(line)   one word out of a POSIX single-quote line (as security_spec always did)
--   fish(line)    fish: inside '...' a backslash escapes `\` and `'`, any other backslash is literal
--   msvcrt(line)  the C runtime's argv rules (what a program started from cmd.exe receives):
--                 2n backslashes + quote -> n backslashes and the quote toggles,
--                 2n+1 backslashes + quote -> n backslashes and a literal quote,
--                 inside quotes `""` is a literal quote, white space outside quotes splits
--   received_args(shell, to_line, words, prefix)
--                 not a model: the REAL thing. Types a quoted line into a real shell and returns the
--                 arguments a real program received (PowerShell's native argument passing differs
--                 between versions, so no model of it would be trusted)
--   installed(exe) whether a program is on the PATH, without the slow scan of a WSL host (see below)

--- Whether `exe` can be started from the PATH. It decides which real-shell cases get registered, and
--- that happens while a spec file is collected, so it must be cheap.
---
--- `vim.fn.executable` looks through every PATH entry, and a miss costs seconds on a WSL host: the
--- Windows PATH is on it (`/mnt/c/...`, a 9p mount where every lookup is a round trip to Windows),
--- and a spec file that asks for a shell that is not installed (`pwsh`, `zsh`) ran into the
--- 10 s limit of a case before its first case even started. A program found through such an entry
--- is a Windows program (`pwsh.exe` is never called `pwsh` there) that the Linux Neovim cannot
--- start by the paths these specs hand over, so on a WSL host those entries are not looked at.
---
--- A WSL host is told by the kernel's name (`...-microsoft-standard-WSL2`), not by
--- `$WSL_DISTRO_NAME`: the spec runner may start its children with a cleaned environment.
